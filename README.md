Game engine ideas:

SFML: Used for making 2D games for the PC coded in C++.
Pros: Fast and apparently the fastest and smoothest engine for PC.
Cons: Not many tutorials compared to others.

SDL: Used for making 2D and 3D games for the PC and mobile coded in C.
Pros: Fast and more tutorials.
Cons: Uses C and mobile implementation is apparently hard.

Cocos: Used for making 2D games for Windows and mobile. Uses C++, javascript and Lua.
Pros: Free, cross platform and beginner friendly.
Cons: Mobile focused.

Unity: Used for making 2D and 3D games for all platforms uses C#.
Pros: 2D might be simpler (not sure about this)
Cons: Might need to pay for certain features and some tutorials are old.

(This one is expensive but James does own a copy of GameMaker from a humble bundle.)
GameMaker Studio 2: Used for making 2D games for all platforms uses GML (like C++) but mostly drag drop.
Pros: Easy, can switch between drag and drop and coding when needed.
Cons: costs $100 and development costs over $1000 to deploy to all platforms.
